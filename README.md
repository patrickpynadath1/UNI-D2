# UNI-D² Research Codebase

[![Documentation](https://img.shields.io/badge/docs-online-blue)](https://nkalyanv99.github.io/UNI-D2/)

Moving beyond the constraints of autoregressive modeling, UNI-D² brings the benefits of iterative refinement—data efficiency, bidirectional context, and parallel decoding—to the text domain. This library serves as the missing foundation for this rapidly growing space, featuring an easily extendible architecture that supports multiple modular training methods. Our unified pipeline facilitates rapid experimentation, enables comparable evaluation, and standardizes benchmarks across the field.

## Highlights
- Hydra + Lightning entry point (`python -m discrete_diffusion`) for experimenting with MDLM, UDLM, BD3LM, FlexMDM, GIDD, SEDD, and PartitionMDLM papers.
- Sampling helpers that cover absorbing, BD3LM, GIDD, partition, uniform, autoregressive, and FlexMDM samplers plus a reusable `scripts/generate_samples.sh` wrapper.
- Scripts that reproduce training recipes for datasets such as LM1B, OWT, and Text8.

## Getting Started

### Installation
```bash
pip install -e .
```

If you want to isolate dependencies in a Conda env, create/activate it before running the editable install:
```bash
conda create -n uni-d2 python=3.11
conda activate uni-d2
pip install -e .
```

For systems with Flash Attention (CUDA 11.4+), install it after the editable install to boost throughput:
```bash
pip install flash-attn --no-build-isolation
```

For development you can install the extras that power testing and docs:
```bash
pip install -e "[dev]"
pip install flash-attn --no-build-isolation  # optional
```

The `pyproject.toml`/`requirements.txt` pair declare the dependencies that power training, evaluation, and sampling.

## How to run

### Training experiments
Run the Hydra-powered CLI exported at `src/discrete_diffusion/__main__.py` with dataset/model/algorithm overrides. A minimal example inspired by the scripts in `scripts/train/`:
```bash
PYTHONPATH=src python -u -m discrete_diffusion \
  data=owt \
  model=small \
  algo=mdlm \
  loader.batch_size=32 \
  trainer.devices=8 \
  hydra.run.dir=./outputs/owt/mdlm
```
The `scripts/train/` directory contains dataset-specific recipes (e.g., `owt/`, `lm1b/`, `text8/`). Override any Hydra config key by appending `key=value` pairs on the command line.

### Generating samples
Once you have a checkpoint, the helper script `scripts/generate_samples.sh` wraps the sampler APIs:
```bash
./scripts/generate_samples.sh \
  outputs/owt/bd3lm_block16_debug/checkpoints/last.ckpt \
  --sampler bd3lm \
  --num-samples 16 \
  --num-steps 2000
```
See `scripts/README_SAMPLING.md` for sampler options, CLI arguments, and example workflows.

## Repository Structure
- `configs/`: Hydra configuration tree for datasets, models, and learners.
- `examples/`: Scripts and notebooks that reproduce experiments and visualizations.
- `scripts/`: Training installers, sampling helpers, and verification checks (see `scripts/README_SAMPLING.md`).
- `src/discrete_diffusion`: Entry points, Hydra CLI, and the discrete diffusion training API.
- `outputs/`: Default Hydra root for logged checkpoints and metrics.
- `docs/`: Supporting documentation for research artifacts.
- `FlexMDM/`, `gidd/`: Reference implementations for specific papers when needed.
- `pyproject.toml` / `requirements.txt`: Dependency and tooling metadata.

## Contributing
Our goal is to maintain this repository as the unified starting point for future research in discrete diffusion for text, keeping it ever-growing and relevant as the field progresses. As such, it will effectively *always* be a work in progress. We welcome any contributions to help it evolve—ranging from full paper implementations with benchmarking to recommendations for features to be added.
